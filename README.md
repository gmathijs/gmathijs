- 👋 Hi, I’m @gmathijs (Gaston)
I am born in 1959 and saw the computer industry rising. 
I'm not a IT guy although computers and programming has always had my interest.
My background is mechanical engineering and after a career of 40 years I.m now retired.
During my professional life I programmed mainly with old school Fortran and later on with VBa, to speed up my work.
Our IT department did not allow Engineers to program, instead we were supposed to make a functional requirement
but that did not work. Hence VBa :-(
Since my retirement I started with C++ & Python since I like to work with datasets.
In time my goal is to convert the excel sheets which I wrote into python or C++

- 👀 I’m interested in programming 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python with Excel
- 💞️ I’m looking for examples on technical software with visual interface making use of a lot of data,
think of material data, piping data etc.
